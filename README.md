Question A(c)

I would better improve by class designs by focusing on enforcing low coupling. 

For starters, to reduce coupling, I will utilize abstract classes or generic types and methods. 
In this case, one of the examples is making the queue_empty method empty so that it can be implemented in both FIFO and LIFO Queue classes. 
Low coupling is desirable because it will ensure that changing one area of an application will require fewer changes throughout the entire application.
As such, in the long run, this could alleviate a lot of time, effort, and cost associated with modifying and adding new features to an application.

Secondly, I will also practise commenting on code only where necessary. In this code test, I have inserted comments as labels which are rather obvious for some methods. 
The reason for this improvement is because comments that parrot the code offer nothing extra to the reader. 
Instead, a prevalence of noisy comments and incorrect comments in a codebase encourages programmers to ignore all comments, 
either by skipping past them or by taking active measures to hide them.
